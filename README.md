# Compass Ranger

- Welcome to Compass Ranger!

- This is a web app that will help you find and explore all the National Parks in the U.S.A.

- Not only will Compass Ranger help you find the parks, it will also give you the weather for your location, and the weather of park you are considering visiting!

- Upon clicking a park you will be greeted with pictures of the park and an option to see more information


## Below you will find a screenshot of how the site looks and a link that takes you to it!

# Future Development

- Down the line we will implement some directional use to better take advantage of the map we have on the page, and add a road trip option.
